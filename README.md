# Dictionary Android Application

Welcome to the Impressive Dictionary Android Application! This dictionary app is designed to provide users with a seamless experience for looking up word definitions, even when offline. With cutting-edge technologies and a thoughtfully designed architecture, this app sets a new standard for dictionary applications.

## Features

- **Jetpack Compose UI**: The app boasts a beautiful and intuitive user interface powered by Jetpack Compose, Google's modern UI toolkit for building native UIs.

- **Caching with Room Database**: Utilizing Room, the app stores previously searched words in a local database. This ensures that users can access definitions even without an internet connection.

- **Retrofit with Coroutines**: The app employs Retrofit for making API requests in a non-blocking and efficient manner, thanks to the power of Coroutines.

- **Kotlin Language**: The entire app is written in Kotlin, the concise and expressive programming language that makes development a breeze.

- **Flow API**: Leveraging Kotlin's Flow API, the app embraces reactive programming for handling data streams seamlessly.

- **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and making the codebase easier to maintain.

- **Clean Architecture with Domain Layer**: The app's architecture is designed around Clean Architecture principles, with a clear distinction between the data sources, business logic, and presentation layers.

- **ViewModel**: The ViewModel component efficiently handles UI-related data and ensures a smooth interaction between the UI and the underlying data.

- **Dependency Injection with Hilt**: Hilt, a modern dependency injection library, is used to manage dependencies and simplify the app's architecture.

- **Repository Layer**: The repository acts as a single source of truth, managing data from both the network and the local cache. This ensures data consistency and availability, even in challenging network conditions.

- **Coroutine**: Coroutines enable the app to perform asynchronous operations efficiently and manage concurrency with ease.

- **Callback Flow for Network Connectivity**: The app employs a callback flow to receive network connectivity callbacks, allowing it to automatically fetch requested words once the internet connection is restored.

- **SafeApiCall Pattern**: The SafeApiCall pattern centralizes API calls, ensuring robust error handling and reducing redundancy in network-related code.

- **Clean Packaging Structure**: The app's codebase is organized using a clean and logical packaging structure, making it easy to navigate and contribute to.
